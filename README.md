# Notion-Website-clone
Created a website clone of the notion website

This project gives the code for the cloning of a website(Original website link - https://www.notion.so/).

# Steps used to clone the website:
1. Web Scrape the website to extract the HTML, CSS and Javascript files. The extract.py code is used for web scraping.
2. Inspect the original website to understand the styling and other elements of the website.
3. See the DOM to understand the structure of the website.
4. Write the CSS code to add the styling to the HTML code.
5. Download the images from the original website.
6. Add your customizations to the website.

# Customization to the web design
I have tried to give a Christmassy feel to the website. A moving reindeer is added at the starting of the website using Javascript and CSS. The combination of green and white gives a subtle christmas vibe for the viewer.
